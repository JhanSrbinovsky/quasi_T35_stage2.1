!      missing  N    NE    E    SE    S    SW     W   NW   no_dir no_dir
!  x offsets:
         -9,    0,   1,    1,    1,   0,   -1,   -1,  -1,    0,   0,          &
!  y offsets:
         -9,    1,   1,    0,   -1,  -1,   -1,    0,   1,    0,   0           &
         /), (/ 11,2/) )

!      Components of displacement (number of gridboxes) in x and
!      y directions to the immediately downstream gridbox. These
!      correspond to the directions in flow_dir_set.
!      The elements in the 2nd dimension are x and y respectively.
!             e.g. flow_dir_delta(1,1:2)=(/0,1/)
!             flow_dir_set(1) refers to a displacement to the N
!             flow_dir_delta(1,2)=1 means 1 gridbox in the N (y) direction
!             flow_dir_delta(1,1)=0 means no displacement in the W-E (x)
!                                 direction
!     The zeroth column (flow_dir_delta(0,:)) is not currently used, but is
!     included so as to make size(1) of flow_dir_delta and flow_dir_set equal
!     in an attempt for clarity.
!     The "no defined direction" must be the last column.

! Note on flow direction assumptions:
!       values of flow direction code that represent the
!       displacement given by the corresponding positions in flow_dir_delta.
!       The following are the meanings of each element of the array:
!        0: no data value (e.g. over sea)
!        1-8: N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW  i.e. clockwise from N
!             Although referred to via these compass directions, they are used
!             as "grid-relative" directions, i.e. it is assumed that columns
!             run S-N, and rows W-E, so "N" means "same column, one row up".
!             If the grid is actually rotated (so that columns do not run S-N
!             on the earth), the point that is "same column, one row up" in
!             fact does not lie immediately N.
!        9: undefined flow direction (i.e. no outflow, or outflow to sea)
!             For some encoding schemes, there is not a single value that
!             represents undefined flow (e.g. ARC combines values of all
!             directions with equal slope - so "undefined" flow direction
!             depends upon slope to neighbouring points). This is not a problem
!             here, since none of these schemes is currently encoded, BUT may
!             have to be accounted for in future - code could be added below
!             where currently we stop with "unexpected value".
!        Note that the values of flow_dir_set that correspond to "real" flow
!        directions (as opposed to missing data or no defined flow direction)
!        must be >0. Further, ALL values of flow_dir_set (incl sea and no flow)
!        must be >=0. In that case, values <0 can be used to indicate points
!        that have a flow direction that points off the edge of the grid (for
!        non-global applications).  These restrictions are necessary to make
!        the current algorithm work. In particular, a run with a smaller grid
!        (e.g. regional) should give the same routing pathways as a run with a
!        larger grid (at the points that are on both grids).
