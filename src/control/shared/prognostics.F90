MODULE prognostics

  IMPLICIT NONE

! Description
! Module containing all of the prognostic variables,
! i.e.those required to be kept from one timestep
! to another. Variables all appear in a model dump - NOT AT PRESENT!
! And some of these are not prognostics (eg smc)....

! Code Description:
!   Language: FORTRAN 90
!   This code is written to UMDP3 v8.2 programming standards.

! Declarations:
