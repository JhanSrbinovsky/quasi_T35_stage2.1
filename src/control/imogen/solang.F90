!  Unified model deck SOLANG, containing only routine SOLANG.
!    This is part of logical component P233, performing the
!  calculations of the earth's orbit described in the second page of
!  the "Calculation of incoming insolation" section of UMDP 23, i.e.
!  from the sin of the solar  declination, the position of each point
!  and the time limits it calculates how much sunlight, if any, it
!  receives.
!    Written in FORTRAN 77 with the addition of "!" comments and
!  underscores in variable names.
!    Written to comply with 12/9/89 version of UMDP 4 (meteorological
!  standard).
