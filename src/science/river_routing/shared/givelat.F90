!DEPRECATED CODE
!This code was transferred from the UM repository at UM vn9.2 / JULES vn 4.1.
!Future developments will supercede these subroutines, and as such they
!should be considered deprecated. They will be retained in the codebase to
!maintain backward compatibility with functionality prior to
!UM vn10.0 / JULES vn 4.2, until such time as they become redundant.
