MODULE RIV_CONCERNS

  USE regrid_types

  IMPLICIT NONE

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Module: RIV_CONCERNS
!
! Description:
!  Location of persistent data structures needed by
!  the river routing routines to coordinate parallel regridding
!  between atmosphere and river grids.
!
!
! Method:
!   As mentioned data structures below are persistent until the end
!   of a UM run (i.e. allocated but not deallocated, any future
!   modifications should take this into consideration)
!
! Current Code Owner: Please refer to the JULES science module leaders
!   This file belongs in module: Hydrology
!
! Code Description:
!   Language: Fortran 90.
!   This code is written to JULES coding standards v1.
